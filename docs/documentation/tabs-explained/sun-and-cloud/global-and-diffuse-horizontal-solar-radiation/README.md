# Global and Diffuse Horizontal Solar Radiation

Clima displays hourly[ Global and Diffuse](global-diffuse-and-normal-solar-radiation-explained.md) Horizontal [Solar Radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar\_irradiance) values for a typical day for each month.

Typical daily graphs showing the amount of energy gained from the sun have many uses, such as:

* assessing the usefulness of solar shading devices (most useful in locations with high direct component);
* ....
* evaluating sustainable renewable energy solutions such as solar panels.

&#x20;The integral of the curves in the graphs is the total energy (in Wh/mÂ²), supplied by the sun. Be careful in considering the different types of solar radiation.

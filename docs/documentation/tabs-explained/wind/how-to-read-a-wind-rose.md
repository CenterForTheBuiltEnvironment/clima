# How to read a Wind Rose

The [wind rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind\_rose) is used to provide a synthetic overview of how wind speed and direction are typically distributed at a certain location.

Wind speed can be estimated with several scales. One of the first was created by Britain's Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort (1805). The original [Beaufort scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaufort\_scale) goes from 0 to 12, but the **Clima Tool** will show the results from 1 to 9 since it is not common to construct buildings in places with recurrent winds over 100 km/h.

The colors shown for each scale value are those used in the tool's charts.              Source: <a href="https://howtoons.com/The-Beaufort-Scale">howtoons</a></p></figcaption></figure>

Each circle segment shows the winds according to the cardinal direction along which they blow from.

The length of each radius around the circle shows how often the wind blew from that direction. A click of the mouse over each slice of the rose shows therefore the recurrence frequency in which the wind of such intensity is repeated over the analyzed period.

In the seasonal graphs section, **Clima** shows 4 wind roses for the periods of:

* December - February;
* March - May;
* June - August;
* September - December.

Personal viewing periods are available using the last portion of the Wind section, where a wind rose of the desired interval can be generated.

In building design, the wind is addressed in several forms:

* pedestrian and outdoor comfort;
* wind driven natural ventilation;
* pollution dispersal/ outdoor air quality;
* in very hot areas, thoughtful design of indoor patios or wind towers provide naturally mitigated environments;
* in renewable energy, wind data are used to design wind turbines;
* in structural analysis, wind load considerably influences the design of roofs, sheds, or overhanging elements.

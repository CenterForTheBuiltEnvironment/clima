# Climate Profiles Explained

The Climate Profiles graph gives the user the opportunity to observe at a glance the distribution of the data in the EPW file for four key variables and their variation between day and night.

The Climate Profiles graph are [Violin Plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin\_plot). They show the [probability density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability\_density\_function) of the data at different values, usually smoothed by a [kernel density estimator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel\_density\_estimator). Wider sections of the violin plot represent a higher probability that members of the population will take on the given value; the skinnier sections represent a lower probability.&#x20;

On mouse hover, they display various statistical properties of the data:

* maximum value
* minimum value
* mean
* median
* 1st quartile
* 3rd quartile

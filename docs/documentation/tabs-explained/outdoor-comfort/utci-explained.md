# UTCI explained

The Universal Thermal Comfort Index (UTCI), introduced in 1994, aims to be the measure of human physiological reaction to the atmospheric environment.&#x20;

It considers dry bulb temperature, solar radiation (mean radiant temperature), wind speed and relative humidity to calculate a reference environmental temperature causing strain when compared to a reference individual's response to the real environment(Zare et al.). It is based on Fiala et al.'s multi-node model of thermo regulation.&#x20;

The UTCI tab allows users to analyze outdoor thermal comfort for a combination of different meteorological conditions based on the presence or absence of sun and wind.&#x20;

The UTCI can then be visualized for the entire year for the scenario chosen. A second chart maps if people will experience thermal stress for all the hours of the year for corresponding UTCI temperatures.

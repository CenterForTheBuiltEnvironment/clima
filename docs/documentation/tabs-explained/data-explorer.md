# Data Explorer

The last section of **Clima** allows for a deeper analysis of all the data in the [Clima dataframe](tab-summary/clima-dataframe.md).

The tab is divided into three sections:

* Single-variable analysis
* Single-variable + filter analysis
* Triple-variable + filter analysis

The single-variable analysis allows data to be displayed in 4 outputs: a yearly chart,  monthly daily charts, an annual heatmap chart, and a descriptive statistics table.

The single-variable + filter analysis allows data to be displayed in a customizable heatmap. The chart can be created starting from one variable inside the Clima dataframe and, eventually, filtered by another one.

The triple-variable + filter analysis allows data to be displayed in two composite charts, a scatterplot, and a heat map. The baselines of the two graphs are driven by the choice of one variable to be placed on the x-axis and one on the y-axis. Then, data can be colored according to a third variable and filtered according to a fourth.

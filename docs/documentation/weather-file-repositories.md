# Weather file repositories

In addition to the data from  [Energy Plus](https://energyplus.net/weather) and [Climate.One.Building.org](http://climate.onebuilding.org/) CBE Clima Tool allows users to visualize any valid EPW file. Below we list some free sources from which climate files can be obtained.&#x20;

The following sources will be divided according to:

* [Typical Meteorological Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typical\_meteorological\_year) (TMY), in which weather data are condensed into a year of the most usual conditions;
* [Actual Meteorological Year](https://d3pcsg2wjq9izr.cloudfront.net/files/41253/download/379637/TMY\_and\_AMY\_Files.pdf) (AMY), aka actual hourly data sets over a year time period, put into the same formats as a TMY file.

**TMY repositories:**

* ****[Climate.OneBuilding](https://climate.onebuilding.org/);
* [EnergyPlus](https://energyplus.net/weather);
* European commission [Photovoltaic Geographical Information System](https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvg\_tools/it/#TMY);
* [CSIRO](https://agdatashop.csiro.au/future-climate-predictive-weather) projected weather files for future climate scenarios for Australian locations;
* University of Exeter [Prometheus](https://engineering.exeter.ac.uk/research/cee/research/prometheus/termsandconditions/futureweatherfiles/), current and future weather files for British cities



**AMY repositories:**

* NASA [Power tool](https://power.larc.nasa.gov/data-access-viewer/);
* Pacific Northwest National Laboratory [diyepw tool](https://github.com/IMMM-SFA/diyepw) (given set of WMOs station)

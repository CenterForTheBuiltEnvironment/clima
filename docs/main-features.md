# Main features

Beyond allowing the display of daily, monthly, and yearly plots of most variables contained in EPW files,[ Clima](https://clima.cbe.berkeley.edu/) calculates heating and cooling degree days, generates customizable wind roses, sun paths, psychrometric charts, and more.

Furthermore, there are tabs dedicated to understanding natural ventilation potential, investigating UTCI thermal stress and equivalent temperatures under different scenarios, and exploring correlations among data in the EPW.

All the graphics are downloadable in high-quality vector format \(.svg\) and free to use for research, educational and professional purposes and are licensed under a permissive[ Creative Commons \(CC BY 4.0.\) license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). The source code -mostly Python- is also available on[ GitHub](https://github.com/CenterForTheBuiltEnvironment/clima) under[ MIT licence](https://github.com/CenterForTheBuiltEnvironment/clima/blob/main/LICENSE) for anyone to freely use, re-use, or misuse.

## Versions

[The CBE Clima Tool](https://clima.cbe.berkeley.edu/) is still in its infancy and what we are releasing here is a beta version. Much work still needs to be done, especially in developing a comprehensive documentation. The comments, suggestions, critiques \(and offers of help\) of this community are most welcome!

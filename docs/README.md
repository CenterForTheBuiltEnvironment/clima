# CBE Clima Tool

The CBE Clima Tool is a web-based application built to support climate analysis specifically designed to support the need of architects and engineers interested in climate-adapted design. It allows users to analyze the climate data of more than 27,500 locations worldwide from both [Energy Plus](https://energyplus.net/weather) and [Climate.One.Building.org](http://climate.onebuilding.org/). You can, however, also choose to upload your own EPW weather file. Our tool can be used to analyze and visualize data contained in EnergyPlus Weather (EPW) files. It furthermore calculates a number of climate-related values (i.e. solar azimuth and altitude, Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), comfort indices etc.) that are not contained in the EPW files but can be derived from the information therein contained. It can be freely accessed at [clima.cbe.berkeley.edu](http://clima.cbe.berkeley.edu)

If you use this tool please consider citing us.

The CBE Clima Tool is open source. We have released the source code on a [public repository](https://github.com/CenterForTheBuiltEnvironment/clima). We welcome contributions from the community \([more info here](contributing/contributing.md)\).

[Clima](https://clima.cbe.berkeley.edu/) has been made possible by the support of the [Centre for the Built Environment at UC Berkeley](https://cbe.berkeley.edu/) and [SinBerBEST](https://sinberbest.berkeley.edu). The tool was developed by: [Giovanni Betti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gbetti/), [Christine Nguyen](https://chrlng.github.io/), [Federico Tartarini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/federico-tartarini-3991995b/). We also would like to thank [Stefano Schiavon](https://ced.berkeley.edu/ced/faculty-staff/stefano-schiavon) for his guidance and support.
